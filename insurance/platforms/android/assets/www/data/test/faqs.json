			"faqId" : 7,
			"question" : "What is rental reimbursement?",
			"answer" : "Rental Reimbursement is an optional coverage that helps pay your rental car costs while your car is being repaired as a result of a covered claim. You can generally keep the rental car until your damaged vehicle is back on the road or until your coverage limit runs out, whichever comes first. If your vehicle is a total loss, the amount of authorized rental time will be limited, so you should begin shopping for a replacement as soon as you learn your vehicle is a total loss."
