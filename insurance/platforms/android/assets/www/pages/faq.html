		        <p>1. The liability examiner reviews the insurance policy and the coverage in effect for the loss to determine what types of damage or injuries are covered.<br>2. The liability examiner attempts to contact everyone involved in the accident - drivers, passengers, witnesses, etc. - to get everyone's account of the accident.<br>3. When there are conflicting versions of what occurred in the accident, the liability examiner conducts an in-depth interview with each person involved. These interviews help resolve disputes over the facts of the accident.<br>4. The liability examiner gathers and reviews additional relevant information, such as the police report, applicable state and local traffic laws, and photos of the scene and the vehicles involved.<br>5. The liability examiner considers all the facts, determines the cause of the accident, and handles the claim accordingly</p>

		        <h3>What is rental reimbursement?</h3>
		        <p>Rental Reimbursement is an optional coverage that helps pay your rental car costs while your car is being repaired as a result of a covered claim. You can generally keep the rental car until your damaged vehicle is back on the road or until your coverage limit runs out, whichever comes first. If your vehicle is a total loss, the amount of authorized rental time will be limited, so you should begin shopping for a replacement as soon as you learn your vehicle is a total loss.</p>
